# Bank_Customer_Churn
A machine learning-powered web app (built with Streamlit) that predicts whether a bank customer will churn (leave the bank) based on their profile. The model is trained on customer data with features like credit score, age, tenure, balance, products owned, credit card status, activity, salary, geography, and gender.
